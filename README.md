# ornament-lamp-shade
A nice OpenSCAD-encoded lamp shade-like shape. Uses a scaled down version of kintel's list-comprehension-demos: https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos

The shape is inspired by [RIBONE STRAIGHT](https://cults3d.com/en/home/ribone) but has lower intermediate ribs and a narrower, more drawn out top. Also, it is not hollow or in any other way adapted to fit any particular lamp foot.
